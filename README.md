This repository contains a handpicked set of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems grouped by **commonly used patterns** in coding interviews and competitive programming.

Instead of solving random problems, this **pattern-based approach** helps you understand the core logic behind different types of questions. By learning these patterns, you can solve problems faster and more confidently in interviews and contests.

## 🔍 Why Pattern Identification?

Most DSA problems follow a small number of recurring patterns. Once you identify the right pattern, solving the problem becomes easier and more intuitive. This approach improves both **speed** and **accuracy** during interviews.

## 📂 Patterns Covered

Inspired by popular resources like **Striver's DSA Sheet**, this repository includes:

- **Sliding Window** – Subarray/substring problems with fixed or variable size  
- **Two Pointers** – Finding pairs, sorted arrays, or merging  
- **Fast & Slow Pointers** – Cycle detection and mid-points in linked lists  
- **Merge Intervals** – Overlapping intervals and timeline merging  
- **Greedy** – Local optimal choices for global optimization  
- **Binary Search** – Efficient search in sorted data or answer space  
- **Backtracking** – Recursively build solutions (e.g., permutations, N-Queens)  
- **Dynamic Programming** – Solve overlapping subproblems with memoization  
- **Heap / Priority Queue (Top K Elements)** – Track top or frequent items  
- **Graph (BFS / DFS / Topo Sort)** – Path finding, cycle detection, and traversal  
- **Trie** – Fast prefix and word-based searching  
- **Segment Trees / Fenwick Trees (BIT)** – Efficient range queries and updates  
- **Union Find / Disjoint Set** – Detect cycles or connected components  
- **Stacks & Queues** – Infix evaluation, monotonic structures, etc.  
- **Linked List** – Reversals, cycles, merges, and manipulations  
- **Hashing / Maps / Sets** – Frequency counting and uniqueness checking  
- **Recursion** – Divide and conquer strategies
